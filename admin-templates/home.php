<h2>ddVash Theme Information</h2>

<p><a href="http://dflydev.com/d2code/wordpress/ddvash">ddVash</a> is
intended to be a simple theme upon which more complicated and prettier themes
may be designed. Controls have been added to handle core things like choosing
the visibility, size and location of a sidebar, global width and controlling
whether or not a header image is enabled. Beyond that, the theme is basically
an extremely vanilla version of Twenty Ten.</p>

<h3>Rebuild CSS</h3>
<p>ddVash uses WP-LESS. Under normal circumstances WP-LESS will detect changes
to CSS files and recompile them. Sometimes, especially when using,
a child theme, it may become necessary to rebuild the CSS manually. This can
be done here.
